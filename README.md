# Jenkins Job DSL Gradle Example 

An example [Job DSL](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin) project that uses Gradle for building and testing. Check out [this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSK_JaBacE0) for a walkthrough of this example (starts around 14:00). 

## File structure

    .
    ├── src
    │   ├── jobs                # DSL script files
    │   ├── main
    │   │   ├── groovy          # support classes
    │   │   └── resources
    │   │       └── idea.gdsl   # IDE support for IDEA
    │   ├── scripts             # scripts to use with "readFileFromWorkspace"
    │   └── test
    │       └── groovy          # specs
    └── build.gradle            # build file

## Testing

`./gradlew test` runs the specs.

[JobScriptsSpec](src/test/groovy/com/dslexample/JobScriptsSpec.groovy) 
will loop through all DSL files and make sure they don't throw any exceptions when processed. All XML output files are written to `build/debug-xml`. 
This can be useful if you want to inspect the generated XML before check-in. Plugins providing auto-generated DSL must be added to the build dependencies.

If you prefer to stub the auto-generated DSL, you can use [JobScriptsSpecAlternative](src/test/groovy/com/dslexample/JobScriptsSpecAlternative.groovy),
though you may miss some syntax errors.

## Seed Job

You can create the example seed job via the Rest API Runner (see below) using the pattern `jobs/seed.groovy`.

Or manually create a job with the same structure:

* Invoke Gradle script
   * Use Gradle Wrapper: `true`
   * Tasks: `clean test`
* Process Job DSLs
   * DSL Scripts: `src/jobs/**/*Jobs.groovy`
   * Additional classpath: `src/main/groovy`
* Publish JUnit test result report
   * Test report XMLs: `build/test-results/**/*.xml`

Note that starting with Job DSL 1.60 the "Additional classpath" setting is not available when
[Job DSL script security](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/wiki/Script-Security) is enabled.
